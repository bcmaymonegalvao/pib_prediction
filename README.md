## Version Control Setup

1. Initialize Git in your project directory:
```bash
git init
```

2. Add your remote repository:
```bash
# For HTTPS
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

# For SSH
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repository-name.git
```

3. Create and switch to a new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b main
```

4. Add and commit your files:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

5. Push to your remote repository:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Set up the environment
1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

2. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
poetry shell
```

3. Install dependencies:

- To install all dependencies from pyproject.toml, run:

```bash
poetry install
```

- To install only production dependencies, run:

```bash
poetry install --only main
```

Note: To follow the rest of the instructions in this README (including running tests, generating documentation, and using pre-commit hooks), it is recommended to install all dependencies using `poetry install`.

4. Run Python scripts:

```bash
# Run directly with poetry
poetry run python src/process.py

# Or after activating the virtual environment
python src/process.py
```

## Set up pre-commit hooks
Set up pre-commit:
```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

The pre-commit configuration is already set up in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. This includes:
* `ruff`: A fast Python linter and code formatter that will automatically fix issues when possible
* `black`: Python code formatting to ensure consistent code style
* `mypy`: Static type checking for Python to catch type-related errors before runtime

Pre-commit will now run automatically on every commit. If any checks fail, the commit will be aborted and the issues will be automatically fixed when possible.

## View and alter configurations

The project uses Hydra to manage configurations. You can view and modify these configurations from the command line.

To view available configurations:
```bash
poetry run python src/process.py --help
```

Output:

```yaml
process is powered by Hydra.

== Configuration groups ==
Compose your configuration from those groups (group=option)

model: model1, model2
process: process1, process2


== Config ==
Override anything in the config (foo.bar=value)

process:
  use_columns:
  - col1
  - col2
model:
  name: model1
data:
  raw: data/raw/sample.csv
  processed: data/processed/processed.csv
  final: data/final/final.csv
```

To override configurations (for example, changing the input data file):
```bash
poetry run python src/process.py data.raw=sample2.csv
```

Output:

```
Process data using sample2.csv
Columns used: ['col1', 'col2']
```

You can override any configuration value shown in the help output. Multiple overrides can be combined in a single command. For more information about Hydra's configuration system, visit the [official documentation](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/).

## Auto-generate API documentation
Generate static documentation:
```bash
poetry run pdoc src -o docs
```

Start documentation server (available at http://localhost:8080):
```bash
poetry run pdoc src --http localhost:8080
```

The documentation will be generated from your docstrings and type hints in your Python files. The static documentation will be saved in the `docs` directory, while the live server allows you to view the documentation with hot-reloading as you make changes.
